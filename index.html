                    Remember to use your device with intention. Avoid
                    distractions and make sure each use has a purpose, whether
                    it's for work, learning, or staying connected. It's easy to
                    get lost in endless scrolling or mindless browsing, but your
                    time is valuable. Make every interaction with your device
                    meaningful and productive. Set clear goals for each session,
                    take breaks, and be mindful of how much time you're spending
                    on non-essential activities. By using your device
                    thoughtfully, you can enhance your productivity and
                    well-being.
